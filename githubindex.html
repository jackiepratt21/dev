	<p>Dear GitHub</p>
	<p>Since Valentines day is just around the corner, I thought I should confess my love for you. You are seriously one of a kind! I can share all of my code with you, and see what other people have been putting their amazing minds to. When I am in the terminal, I can <span>cd</span> into my repo github project, with <span>git remote add origin github-repo-url</span> and then <span>git push -u origin master</span> to get it over there. You let me see what I have done with <span>git status</span> and <span>git add .</span> and can't forget to <span>git commit -m</span> to save my changes. You <span>git push</span> me to do my best and post my work, and I appreciate that.</p> <p>Most of my friends have no idea what I am talking about when I mention you, and when I try to explain it to people who don't they clearly don't care. But I do! I can collaborate with other people who understand how awesome you are!</p>
	<p>The fact that I can even see who is contributing how much is seriously so helpful, the I can really see who cares about you! Because if they don't enjoy spending time with you, then I don't enjoy spending time with them.</p>
	<p>You really are one in a million, and I can't wait to see what adventures this relationship takes us on!</p>
	<p>Happy Valentines Day,</p>
	<p>Jax</p>
