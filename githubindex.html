	<p>Dear GitHub</p>
	<p>Since Valentines day is just around the corner, I thought I should confess my love for you. You are seriously one of a kind! I can share all of my code with you, and see what other people have been putting their amazing minds to. Most of my friends have no idea what I am talking about when I mention you, and when I try to explain it to people who don't they clearly don't care. But I do! I can collaborate with other people who understand how awesome you are!</p>
	<p>The fact that I can even see who is contributing how much is seriously so helpful, the I can really see who cares about you! Because if they don't enjoy spending time with you, then I don't enjoy spending time with them.</p>
	<p>You really are one in a million, and I can't wait to see what adventures this relationship takes us on!</p>
	<p>Happy Valentines Day,</p>
	<p>Jax</p>
