        <p>Imagine being something warm, salty, savory, and wonderful. A crispy, somewhat smooth, crunchy outer layer, and a saucy, meaty, flavorful inside. Well, that is what our story is all about. The wonderful world of...tacos.</p>

        <p>Ortega was a lonely shell, with no one to fill his heart. He was on the dry foods side of the Mexican section in the store, while all of the other softies were on the opposite side, unable to reach each other.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="two">
        <p>He thought about Tia Rosa all the time. She had a gorgeous golden brown color, and soft, squishy features. All he wanted was to be next to her, but there was no way they could survive that jump from the opposite side of the aisle. Ortega's ultimate mission was to get over to Tia Rosa and run away together to the meat section and drench themselves in Lawry's so they can literally fill themselves with happiness.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="three">
        <p>Ortega waited days, hoping for that one chance to reach his beloved. The day finally came when one evening, before closing, a bag of dried beans was knocked off the shelf, and was perfectly content to sleep there.</p>

        <p>That night, after the lights were out, Ortega made his move. While his compadres slept, he grabbed a spare shred of wrapping from the back of the shelf. Then, shell shaking, he leapt off the top shelf of the dry foods side of the Mexican section of the Whole Foods.</p>
         </article>

        <article class="four">
        <p>This turned out to be a terrible idea. Wrapping paper immediately flew out of his hands, he fell off course, and his only saving grace was that he managed to hit the very corner of the beans. CRACK! Ortega, landed at the base of the shelf, with a small crack, on his right shell. He had made it down.</p>
       
        
       
       
        <p>He was starting to doubt himself as he slowly crossed the aisle. Would Tia Rosa still like him with his cracked shell? Tia Rosa was so beautiful and he knew she could have any other shell she wanted. Everyone wanted to be plated with Tia Rosa. He had made it this far though, so he knew he had to try to win her heart.</p>

        <p>As he got closer to the shelf, he looked up and saw her peering over the edge and waving at him. She told him she was going to find something to throw down for him to climb up, and then she disappeared amongst the crowd of softies. The next thing he knew, a long piece of tape was being lowered down to him. He grabbed on to the sticky side, and began climbing up towards his beloved Tia Rosa.</p>
        </article>
        

        <article class="five">
        <p>As Ortega triumphantly ascended, he knew that his lifelong dream was within seconds of fulfillment. The whole aisle was cheering him on, and with his last ounce of strength he reached Tia Rosa's shelf.</p>

        <p>Ortega could not believe how beautiful Tia Rosa was up close, he could barely think of something to say. After a long awkward pause, he finally stated "I have to take you somewhere." He took her by the hand and in once smooth motion they swung down by the same tape he had used to climb to his love.</p>

        <p>They made it to the ground safely and started to run as fast as they could, knowing that they would soon be filled with meaty goodness. Rounding the corner into the meat section the came to a dead stop, and their jaws dropped. They had never seen something so beutiful and enticing.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="six">
        <p>Ready to be filled with meat, they entered the aisle together. That was the last anyone has heard from Ortega and Tia Rosa, we can only assume they got lost in the ecstacy of all that meat.</p>
