		<h2>Star Wars Sprites</h2>
		<p>Lion! Congratulations, you played yourself. I’m up to something. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. How’s business? Boomin. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth.</p>

		<h2>Music, Sports, and Frands, what else do you need?</h2>
		<p>It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. We don’t see them, we will never see them. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. Hammock talk come soon. Always remember in the jungle there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise.

		Cloth talk. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch. It’s important to use cocoa butter. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough? I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. Eliptical talk. Another one. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed.</p>
