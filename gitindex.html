<h1>Git, You Rock My World</h1>

<body>
<div class="container">
	<p>Git:</p>
	<p>You are so damn smart. You just <span>gitinit</span> like a pro and create a super secret folder for me. It is so easy to see how you are doing with <span>git status</span> and <span>git add .</span>, and I can easily <span>git commit -m</span> to you, and have a permanent record I can always look to.</p> <p>If I forget who I am, you're there for me with <span>git log,</span> and I remember.</p> <p>You are able to store so much information. But, you're not like other smart machines. You're able to really think about information differently. You give that information a purpose, or nice summary...a snapshot if you will. That way, you allow me to efficiently keep track of my progress with my files.</p> <p>Even if I haven't changed, you keep that in mind, and are just so chill about it. Who needs to change all the time, anyway? You rock my world!</p>
	<p>love,</p>
