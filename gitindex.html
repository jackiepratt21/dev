	<p>Git:</p>
	<p>You are so damn smart. You are able to store so much information. But, you're not like other smart machines. You're able to really think about information differently. You give that information a purpose, or nice summary...a snapshot if you will. That way, you allow me to efficiently keep track of my progress with my files.</p> <p>Even if I haven't changed, you keep that in mind, and are just so chill about it. Who needs to change all the time, anyway? You rock my world!</p>
	<p>love,</p>
