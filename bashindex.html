	<p>Dear Bash,</p>

<p>Sometimes, I just don't get you. You say one thing, then tell me the other. Sometimes I get too excited and <span>press enter</span> too soon and you get so mad that I have to press some random keys to get back to where we started. Why do you do this? I know you just want to start over sometimes, and I press <span>control K</span> to get there, but then it is just a whole process to get going again. Just let me do what I need to do so we can move on. I know that sometimes I can't live without you, and you cant't live without me. I type <span>pwd</span> to find out where I am, because I sometimes just get lost in you, and need to check myself, and bring it back to reality, as well as see what is happening with <span>ls.</span> I <span>touch</span> you, you understand, and create a new file. And even when I tell you to <span>mkdir</span>, you just get it, and make a new directory for me! Even if I want to change what I am working on with <span>cd,</span> you pull through every time.</p> <p>You're also pretty good at responding to my commanding language, for the most part, but I think I just need to learn how to communicate with you better, so you can communicate better with me. I promise I will make it a point to practice every day with you, so we can have a healthy, functional relationship with each other. I love ya, bash. Bless up.</p>
